# Deep Learning Project
## Disaster Tweets Project
### Description
This is a competition from Kaggle named Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets. 
Since Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency, this project aims to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not.
### Dataset
Dataset is provided by Kaggle
#### Results
Notebook DL_Disaster_tweets.ipynb can deliver:
- Some visualization of data
- NLP models (RNN, GRU, LSTM) to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not
- The F1 score to assess the performance of each model
